# Portfolio Website
The published website is `https://raykil.github.io`.

## Webpage Development
For development, run `app.py` and use the localhost server `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` for quick iterations.

## Freeze
Freezing is taking a snapshot of the current version of the website. Freezing is used because github.io website platform only supports static websites. Run `freeze.py` to make a static snapshot of the current website. The snapshot is stored in `build` directory. This directory should be pushed to `static` branch, since the github repo is configured to display the contents in `static` branch to `raykil.github.io`.
